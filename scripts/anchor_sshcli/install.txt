=== INSTALL CRON ===

crontab -e

1       */12    * * *   $HOME/anchor_sshcli/logrotate.sh
0,30    *       * * *   killall -9 ssh
@reboot $HOME/anchor_sshcli/logrotate.sh
@reboot $HOME/anchor_sshcli/go_anchor_sshcli.sh


=== CREATE SSH KEYS ===

ssh-keygen -b 4096

Connect once manually to the server, to add it to the known keys.
Repeat for each connection method (e.g. to IP address, to domain name).

Also add the key there to authorized keys and so on.


=== LOG INTO YOURSELF for TEST ===

cat  ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub   > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# also as root add to sshd_config and restart

ssh localhost 


This is needed so that the user running the revssh client, e.g. user "clissh" should log into himself via the remote port he created to terst if the
tunnel is working.

=== YOU MUST CONFIGURE : the revssh server ===

sshd_config on the revssh server

disable Banner
enable AllowOpen

Example:

...

Match group revssh
   AllowTcpForwarding yes
   PermitTunnel no
   X11Forwarding no
   #GatewayPorts clientspecified
   AllowAgentForwarding no
   PermitOpen localhost:29001 localhost:29002 localhost:29011 localhost:29012
   ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/shell_revssh
...


=== configure the client sshd ===
Enable to ssh login into this user clissh from localhost too.
That is needed for ping test for example


=== configure the client user ===

User clissh@clientmachine

run the connections from sshcli@ user to both the revssh server and to your localhost (type as localhost@ !!) to accept the ssh key
connect localhost -p 29011 etc from sshcli@ to accept the ssh key (it's a pain, you must first start this script) or the pings will fail/hang
